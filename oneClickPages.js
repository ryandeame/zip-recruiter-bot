// --- Logic Explanation: Automated Question Answering with Puppet ---
//
// 1. Retrieve the Response:
//    - The application receives a JSON response from ZipRecruiter containing the current group of screening questions.
//    - Each question includes its text, type, and a list of possible options.
//
// 2. Analyze the Information:
//    - The code parses the response to extract the questions and their available options.
//    - Logic is applied to determine which answer to select (e.g., always select "Yes", or use custom logic based on question text).
//
// 3. Use the Puppet Class to Interact with the Page:
//    - The Puppet singleton is used to get the active browser page.
//    - For each question, the script locates the corresponding input (e.g., radio button) on the page using Puppeteer's page methods.
//    - The script selects the desired answer by clicking the appropriate option.
//    - After all questions are answered, the script locates and clicks the "Continue" button to advance to the next group.
//
// Example (pseudo-code):
// const puppet = await Puppet.getInstance();
// const page = puppet.getActivePage();
// for (const question of questions) {
//     // Find the selector for the desired option (e.g., label text or value)
//     await page.click('input[value="1"]'); // Select "Yes"
// }
// await page.click('button[type="submit"]'); // Click Continue
//
// This process repeats for each group of questions until all are completed.
